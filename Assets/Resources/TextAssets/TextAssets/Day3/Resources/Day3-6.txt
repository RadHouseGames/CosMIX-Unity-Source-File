<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> Great, that just hit the spot. Hey, let me tell you about something insane which happened on our cruise ship last night. 

<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> We were flying to one of our polar bases when we got a report from head office saying there was supposedly a strange unidentified lifeform on the ship. 

<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> This sent us all into a bit of a panic, and when we had a look round, we couldn't find anything. The only living things on the ship were eachother!

<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> It wasn't the best thing that's ever happened to me, I'll tell you that much. Suddenly nobody could trust each other. 

<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> Not to mention how someone kept sabotaging all of our ship functions, which made it ten times harder to do any of our basic routines. 


<color=#ad396b><b>{Meryl:}</b></color> Gah, stressful days like this just make me want to drink. throw me something FRUITY.
