<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> Hey, I should say, I really rate the outfit. Wish I could work in a smart outfit like that, us space engineers are stuck in these nasty overalls all the time. 

<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> Hm? Who do I work for? Well, I run my own company, Atomic World ltd. We've got a few different divisions, almost too much for me to handle, believe me. 

<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> I was thinking of expanding into leisure and opening a hotel/bar type thing but I think I'd be clueless when it comes to how to run it.

<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> ...Maybe you could come tell me what to do? Hah.

<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> Think I might have something a little heavier now, I feel like being brave, how about something REALLY strong? 

<color=#be4a17><b>{Lawrence:}</b></color> Maybe give me something I couldn't find many other places.
