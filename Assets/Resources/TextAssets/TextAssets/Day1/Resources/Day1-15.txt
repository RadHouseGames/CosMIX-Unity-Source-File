<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> <color=#d3eee5><b>Moonshine</b></color> is quite an interesting name. I take it you know where it comes from? 

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> What? Surely you know?

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> Well, one of the other bartenders who works here told me it's based off an old Earth trope where people would brew their own alcohol...

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> Supposedly it was outlawed, how crazy is that? 

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> But hey, since this place is called the Moonshot, you must be sick of moon puns, right?  

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> Not much of a talker, are you?

<color=#51a2aa><b>{Marcus:}</b></color> Eh, whatever. Wouldn't mind a <color=#7766b8><b>Midnight Moon</b></color> if you would be so kind.
