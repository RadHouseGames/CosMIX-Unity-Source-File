<color=grey><b>{Kaline:}</b></color> Well, @, I mean when I say you've done a great job. I should warn you though, we have an inspection today by the big boss. 

<color=grey><b>{Kaline:}</b></color> I'll be hanging around the branch for most of today so I may pop back and forth. 

<color=grey><b>{Kaline:}</b></color> I think you'll know who he is when you see him. Anyways, I'm going to head into the back, see you in a bit!
