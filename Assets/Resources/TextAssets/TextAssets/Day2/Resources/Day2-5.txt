<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Well, I suppose I owe you the story now! 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> It was quite the panic I tell you, I was delivered this Catnip plant by a corporation called <color=#be4a17><b>Atomic Plants</b></color>, quite the name, wouldn't ya say? 
 
<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> They asked me to "keep it alive" and said they'd come to pick it up by the end of the day.

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Ack, hold that my throat burns! Can I get a <color=#acc8d7><b>Water Cyclone</b></color> real quick?
