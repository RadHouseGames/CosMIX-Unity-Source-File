<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Cough cough, sorry about that.

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Anyways, I wasn't quite sure what they meant by "keep it alive", 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> so I was keeping my eye on it for a few minutes before finding out that it was some hyperactive plant that could grow and die in minutes! 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> I'll tell ya', I was runnin' all over the place tryna' keep that thing alive. 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> I had to wrestle cows for fertiliser, old ladies for tools and leap over ducks to even make it back to tell the tale!

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> I got quite a reward though, so I ain't complainin'. 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Anyways, I won't bore ya' with much more. I'll be off now. Take care, stranger~
