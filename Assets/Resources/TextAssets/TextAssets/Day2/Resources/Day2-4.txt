<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Usually I like to come here after my days at the farm, it's a nice way to unwind after a long day, you hear?

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> I'll tell ya it was mighty weird when they made us move up here, was so used to normal gardenin', then I suddenly had to start learnin' how to do it in zero gravity!

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> Though, lemme tell you one time when I had to tend to a hyper-active- actually, I'll order a drink first. 

<color=#990f00><b>{April:}</b></color> How about a small drink? Preferably quite strong, you hear?
