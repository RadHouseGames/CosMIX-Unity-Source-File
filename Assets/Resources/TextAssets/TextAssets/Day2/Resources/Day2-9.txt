<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Sigh. Fine. I'll tell you. My name isn't actually <color=#9c329c><b>Ephraim Pinkerton.</b></color> It's <color=#9c329c><b>Dazza.</b></color>

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> But I'm NOT taking off the helmet! It's an essential part of the look y'know!

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> I was thinking, where does the <color=#eb9308><b>Void Orange</b></color> in a <color=#ad145b><b>Blood Moon</b></color> come from? Are they actually plucked out of the void? 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> I mean with those nasty mini black-holes on the insides they seems like they could come from anywhere. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> That said, I love the <color=#b5beff><b>Cosmic Liqueur</b></color> Such a unique taste. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> I remember someone telling me that's the alcohol equivalent which most bars and clubs use out here. How do you even get it?

<color=#9c329c><b>{Dazza:}</b></color> Argh, too many questions, I think I'm getting a headache. Well, I guess that means it's time to go. Take care bartender!
