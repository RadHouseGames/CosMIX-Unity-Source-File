<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Now that I've got that down I feel a bit better. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> I tell you, life's kinda boring man. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Once you hit a million twitch followers it doesn't really like life can go any further than that. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Oh, woe is me, what am I to do!?

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> ...

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> What kind of streamer am I you ask?

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Well, I stream lots of things! Like, One of Us! Isolated: Aliens! 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> You know, big games like that. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Though, I do prefer how streaming worked back on earth. 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> I used to just sit on my chair and while away the hours doing whatever I want. Now all these holograms freak me out!  

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> I can't deal with everyone being able to see almost everything I do! 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> That's why I wear this suit, see?

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Hey, I don't suppose you've seen any cosplayers in this bar, have you? 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> I was meant to be meeting someone nearby but I thought I'd stop by and see if they'd been here.

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> ...

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> What? Am I a cosplayer? No! This is just how I look! I am Daz- I mean Ephraim Pinkerton! That is my name! 

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> ...

<color=#9c329c><b>{Ephraim:}</b></color> Sorry, that was a bit much. I might as well order another drink while I'm here. Can I get something <color=red><b>red</b></color> please?
